# OpenGL Triangle Rendering Application

This project demonstrates the basics of rendering a simple triangle using OpenGL. It is implemented in C++ using the GLFW and GLAD libraries for window management and OpenGL.

## Features

- Renders a simple triangle on the screen using OpenGL.
- Uses vertex and fragment shaders written in GLSL.
- Utilizes GLFW for window creation and event handling.
- Implements the OpenGL rendering pipeline for efficient graphics rendering.

## Requirements
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (for window and input management)
- [GLAD](https://github.com/dav1dde/glad) (for loading OpenGL functions)
- OpenGL 3.3 or higher
